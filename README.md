# Airport Runway Simulation (C++)

🛫 A C++ event-driven simulation for managing aircraft landings and takeoffs. Prioritizes flight operations using priority queues and simulates runway usage over time.

---

## 🧠 Problem Solved

Models how airports manage limited runway availability, ensuring high-priority flights land first while minimizing wait time and congestion.
